## Learning the Language Basics

I worked on making a website that would help me keep track of all of the notes I took while learning coding languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is to simplify the process of going back and reviewing my learning. I did this with the help of the coding instructions from University of Minnesota. I was able to learn and follow instructions to create a repository, pushing and pulling any changes that were made from my local computer into GitHub and vise-versa. I learned how all three languages are different but collaborate with one another to make a whole website, each taking care of a specific aspect like interaction (JavaScript), style (CSS) or layout (HTML).

## Usage

Each section on the website has notes about things that we learned from each language in the Prework section of the course, making reviewing much more efficient. We can also go into the console of the website in order to see a list of the topics that we reviewed, choosing for us what we should study next.
